                            <p>Instead of having students stare at their notes for hours on end, where they could easily be distracted, teachers can place their students in a fun, game-like enviornment, where they have to choose the correct answers from the questions given. Teachers are free to customize these questions to their liking. Competition breeds excellence!

                            <p>After each and every session, teachers can view the stats and performance of their class, to get an idea of how well their students are doing. We have an anti-cheat system, which prevents window switching, resizing..etc. Our anti-cheat system also decreases the risk of inaccurate statistics. Teachers will be alerted if a student performs any activity that triggers the system.
